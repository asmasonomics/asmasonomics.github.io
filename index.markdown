The Mason Lab is a bioinformatics group researching human and avian cancers, led by Dr Andrew Mason. The group is part of the Jack Birch Unit for Molecular Carcinogenesis, a research unit core-funded by York Against Cancer, and part of the York Biomedical Research Institute (YBRI) and Department of Biology at the University of York.<br/>
<span style="font-size:1.5em;"> </span>
Our broad aim is to use sequencing data to understand carcinogenesis and to stratify cancers and other diseases in biologically and clinically relevant ways to derive more personalised treatments. <a href="bioresearch">Our research</a> has two main areas: characterising human urothelial carcinoma, and understanding the impacts of endogenous retrovirus interactions in avian and human cancers.
