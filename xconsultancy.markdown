Bioinformatic consultancy covering experimental planning to data analysis is available in three main areas: RNA sequencing (bulk and single cell), variant calling from DNA sequencing, and a specific application of identifying endogenous Avian Leukosis Viruses in bird genomes (with skills transferable to other ERVs and species). Andrew is also able to offer bespoke analysis of other sequencing types (e.g. ChIPseq, ATACseq) - just get in touch to discuss your project.<br/></p>
