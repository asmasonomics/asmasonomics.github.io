<span style="font-size:1.6em;">**ENTHUSE bioinformatics session: using cBioPortal to explore *TP53* mutations**</span><br/>

<p align="justify">This teaching material was designed as the second part of Dr Simon Baker's ENTHUSE project <i>TP53</i> practical, providing hands-on bioinformatic analysis of real cancer sequencing data. This material can be used directly as a web broswer-based tutorial, or adapted with acknowledgement into a specific lesson plan.<br/></p>
[The video embedded below](#session-walkthrough) is a walkthrough of the exercises by Dr Andrew Mason.

### Introduction
<p align="justify">In your laboratory session you identified a mutation in <i>TP53</i> (R273H) using a restriction enzyme site created as a result of the mutation. Excellent work! By finding this specific mutation in the P53 protein ("the guardian of the genome"), you will be able to recommend cerivastatin, a drug which targets mutant versions of P53, reducing the tumour's ability to grow. Not bad for a simple lab-based assay!<br/><br/>
Using mutations to subtype different types of cancer improves our ability to treat cancer properly in the clinic. This is a move towards personalised medicine. But, how did researchers know this mutation existed, and how often do we find it in people with cancer? Commonly occuring mutations, known as <b>hotspots</b>, help us prioritise efforts for drug development, where one drug can help the most people.<br/><br/>
In this session you will explore <i>TP53</i> mutations in over 10,000 cancer samples using <a href="https://www.cbioportal.org/">cBioPortal</a>, a publicly available online resource for cancer genomics. Data mining is now a huge part of biomedical research, and the discipline of <b>bioinformatics</b> combines computational analysis with the interpretation of biological data. You will use the results of tumour DNA sequencing data from 32 different cancer types within <b>The Cancer Genome Atlas</b> (TCGA) study, an enormous international study to better understand the diversity of genetic changes in cancer.<br/></p>

### The Session
<p align="justify">If you follow the guided steps below, you will explore <a href="https://www.cbioportal.org/">cBioPortal</a>, investigate the prevalence of <i>TP53</i> mutations across different cancers, and begin to see the complexity of cancer biology by seeing how different cancers exploit different parts of normal cell biology. Look out for 'explainer' links - these give more information and background to the concepts and data used in the session.<br/><br/>
I would recommend using a computer or a tablet for this session, rather than a phone. cBioPortal hasn't really been designed with phones in mind, and you'll find everything a bit small and tricky to navigate.<br/></p>

#### 1) Open the cBioPortal website
<p align="justify">
Open up any web browser and head to <a href="https://www.cbioportal.org/">www.cbioportal.org</a><br/><br/>
The home screen (pictured below) gives immediate access to results from sequencing data generated from thousands of cancer samples from all over the world. Scroll down the list. Each study represents potentially years of work from doctors, surgeons and nurses in hospitals to recruit patients, work with families and collect samples, and then from biomedical researchers in universities to process the samples, then generate, analyse, interpret and publish the results.<br/></p>

<br/>

#### 2) Select the pancancer TCGA dataset
<p align="justify">
Return to the top of the cBioPortal homepage. We're going to work with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pancancer study. "Pan" in this context just means "across lots of different cancers".<br/>
Click the Quick select link for <b>TCGA PanCancer Atlas Studies</b>. This has just loaded data for 32 different cancer studies and 10967 samples coming from 10528 different people! Next, click on the blue <b>Query By Gene</b> button, scroll to the bottom and type <b>TP53</b> into the Enter Genes box, then <b>Submit Query</b>.<br/>
