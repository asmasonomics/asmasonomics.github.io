<p align="justify">Andrew currently leads 2<sup>nd</sup> year undergraduate Biology tutorials, introducing sequencing technologies including whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing and the application of new long read technologies. The sessions cover where these data come from, how to correctly design experiments using sequencing, and how to visualise and interpret results. There are multiple opportunities for each student to present, as well as designing experiments and working on real sequencing data. Sequencing technologies change rapidly and we discuss new techniques and their application. <br/><br/>
Andrew's lectureship position will commence in Autumn 2022.<br/></p>
