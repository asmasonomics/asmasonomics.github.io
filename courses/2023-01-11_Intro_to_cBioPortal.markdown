<p align="justify"><a href="https://www.cbioportal.org/">cBioPortal</a> is a publicly available online resource for cancer genomics, with omics and clinical data available for many cancer types. In this 1 hour session we will introduce cBioPortal - what's there, how to use it, and what you can learn from it. We will then have some led problem solving activities to get to grips with the website, and finish with tips and advice for how you can use the data, and how student projects could make use of it.<br/></p>

<p align="justify">This was the first time running the Introduction to cBioPortal course. We are hoping to repeat the course in future, and to develop it into an Elixir online resource for broader use.
Hopefully you have enjoyed the workshop structure and content, but there is always room to improve. We would really appreciate if you could complete <a href="https://elixiruknode.org/">this brief feedback form</a>. This link will be active until the end of the week.<br/></p>
