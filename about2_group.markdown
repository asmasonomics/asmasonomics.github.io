The Mason Lab started in November 2019 when Andrew started a 3-year Independent Research Fellowship in Cancer Informatics funded by [York Against Cancer](https://www.yorkagainstcancer.org.uk/) to commemorate the charity's 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary. This position will mature into a Lectureship in Cancer Informatics in 2022 as part of The University of York's [Department of Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) and [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/).

	content = "Vlad completed an MEng in Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of York before working as a graduate software developer.<br/>In February 2020 he returned to York on a GCRF-funded RA position (predominantly within the Mason lab) which included transcriptomic clustering from low <i>n</i>, high feature datasets and development of an RNAseq visualisation tool. He began a 3-year inter-disciplinary PhD at York in October 2020, and is working on methods to incorporate multiple sequencing data types to improve clinical utility of sequencing-derived bladder cancer subtypes."
