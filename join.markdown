Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are the remnants of retroviral infections in our evolutionary past that contribute 8% of our genome. Whilst HERVs have lost the ability to produce and shed retroviral particles, many have open reading frames and intact regulatory regions. HERV transcripts are readily detected by RNA-sequencing (and typically elevated in cancer), and there are many examples of tissue-specific transcript regulation driven by HERV long terminal repeats.<br/><span style="font-size:1.5em;"> </span>
In this bioinformatics-driven project, you will generate and analyse whole-genome and long-read transcriptome sequencing data from healthy urothelium to identify donor-specific integrations and tissue-specific transcription. As a member of the Jack Birch Unit for Molecular Carcinogenesis, you will also have access to hundreds of additional short and long read RNA sequencing datasets, and single-cell RNAseq, from human urothelium. The project will then address the role for HERVs in urothelial carcinoma, by 1) identifying novel integrations using whole-genome data from the bladder cancer cohort of the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project, and 2) interpreting RNA-sequencing cohort data (such as The Cancer Genome Atlas) based on initial work with normal urothelium.<br/><span style="font-size:1.5em;"> </span>
This project will functionally annotate HERVs in urothelium for the first time, and inform our understanding of HERV dysregulation in urothelial carcinoma; cancers where high-burden mutational profiles are largely attributable to APOBEC-mediated antiviral defence. This project offers training in the analysis and interpretation of large datasets from multiple sequencing technologies, and has the scope to expand to consider the pan-cancer relevance of the results.</p>
