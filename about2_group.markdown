The Mason Lab started in November 2019 when Andrew started a 3-year Independent Research Fellowship in Cancer Informatics funded by [York Against Cancer](https://www.yorkagainstcancer.org.uk/) to commemorate the charity's 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary. This position will mature into a Lectureship in Cancer Informatics in 2022 as part of The University of York's [Department of Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) and [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/).

Grace will build on her PhD research by analysing mutational signatures induced in CIZ1-null colony cultures which emerged due to unstable quiescence, further applying this work to explore CIZ1 biology in a pan-cancer analysis. Grace's fellowship concluded in February 2023 before she headed off on a 3-month trip round Latin America!"
