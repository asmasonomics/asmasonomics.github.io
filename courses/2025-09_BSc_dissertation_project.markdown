This site contains helpful information for completing your 28H final year BSc dissertation project in the Mason Lab. <a href="https://vle.york.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_114373_1/outline">General information on the module is available on the VLE</a> - check this regularly.<br/>
</p>

### Expectations, meetings and assessments
<p align="justify">
Across the year you are expected to spend 1.5-2 days per week on your project, balancing this 40 credit module with your other module topics. As this is a data project, you can be very flexible with when you are working. Remember, this is an individual project (and must be completed and submitted independently), but it is likely the other students who also selected this topic will face similar issues, so support each other! You may enjoy arranging to meet in a computer lab or in the library at the same time in small groups. Whatever works for you.<br/><br/>
28H does have some workshops, so make sure you check the Module Planner on the VLE site and look out for any announcements from the module organiser. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I23Xv6QPa_hg3XFhiO3tt6Ghl3S379HwJx9lddAYUko">There is a useful checklist of expectations available here</a>.<br/>
